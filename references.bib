The satellite images are large in size, acquired from long distances and are affected by noise and other environmental conditions. Hence it is necessary to process them so that they can be used by the researchers for analysis. Satellite images are widely used in many real time applications such as in agriculture land detection, navigation and in geographical information systems. In this paper, a review of some popular machine learning based image processing techniques is presented. Also a detailed comparison of various techniques is performed. Limitations in each image processing method are also described. In addition to reviewing of different methods, different metrics for performance evaluation in each of the image processing areas is studied.},

Classification is a research area in its own right, which over the last 40~years has combined results from disciplines as different as biology, psychology, mathematics, and computer science. Covering such an extensive and varied scientific field with even a minimal claim to completeness is naturally beyond the scope of this text, as is treating all commonly used types of classifiers in mathematical detail. Yet we will at least mention the principal types to give the reader some orientation in this important area of pattern recognition tasks. We will therefore discuss the multilayer perceptron neural network used in the pattern recognition examples of Chap.~5 in depth.},

However, object recognition is a rather broad term and frequently necessitates a multitude of functions to be able to assign objects to a category. Positioning, however, is structurally speaking—not necessarily algorithmically—a rather simple affair as soon as the object in question has been found. The only necessary prerequisite is the segmentation of a reference object. The main reason to begin with this topic is that it represents an absolutely essential “auxiliary science”.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning frameworks have rapidly become the main methodology for analyzing medical images. Due to their powerful learning ability and advantages in dealing with complex patterns, deep learning algorithms are ideal for image analysis challenges, particularly in the field of digital pathology. The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of deep learning includes classification (e.g., healthy vs. cancerous tissue), detection (e.g., lymphocytes and mitosis counting), and segmentation (e.g., nuclei and glands segmentation). The majority of recent machine learning methods in digital pathology have a pre- and/or post-processing stage which is integrated with a deep neural network. These stages, based on traditional image processing methods, are employed to make the subsequent classification, detection, or segmentation problem easier to solve. Several studies have shown how the integration of pre- and post-processing methods within a deep learning pipeline can further increase the model's performance when compared to the network by itself. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the types of methods that are used within deep learning frameworks either to optimally prepare the input (pre-processing) or to improve the results of the network output (post-processing), focusing on digital pathology image analysis. Many of the techniques presented here, especially the post-processing methods, are not limited to digital pathology but can be extended to almost any image analysis field.},
